**htt_library**
===================================
*by* VALLEJO VALLÃ‰S, MARINA

The Python script `htt17_library.py`  generates a library of sequences containing all the single nucleotide mutations for the Htt17 sequence. This library is necessary to perform a deep mutagenesis project. The script can be used with any other sequence in a FASTA file format.

Input files: 

*  htt17.fa

Output files:

*  htt17_sequences_DNA.txt 

*  htt17_sequences_proteins.txt

It also prints the Hamming Distance values for each codon and the final selection.
